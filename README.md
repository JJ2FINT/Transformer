# Transformer-Model-NLP

 A transformer model is a type of neural network architecture used for natural             
  language processing tasks such as language translation, text summarization,              
  and question answering. It was introduced in the 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need"  
  by Google researchers. The transformer uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh           
  the importance of different parts of the input when generating the output,               
  allowing it to effectively handle input sequences of varying lengths                     
  and to parallelize computations across the sequence. This has made transformer           
  models the go-to choice for many NLP tasks, and they have been shown to achieve          
  state-of-the-art results on a wide range of benchmarks.  
  
#how to build a custom model, including the Keras functional API
The Keras functional API allows you to build complex models by connecting pre-defined layers. 
To build a custom model using the functional API, you first need to import the necessary modules from Keras:

from keras.layers import Input, Dense, Activation
from keras.models import Model

Then, you can define the input layer and the output layer for your model using the Input() and Dense() functions. 
The Input() function defines the shape and data type of the input to the model, while the Dense() function defines 
a densely connected layer with a specified number of neurons.

input_layer = Input(shape=(input_shape,))
output_layer = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(input_layer)

Next, you can add any intermediate layers you want to use between the input and output layers using the Dense() 
function and chaining it with the previous layer.

x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(input_layer)
x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)

Finally, you can create your model by instantiating a Model object and specifying the input and output layers.

model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)

Once you have defined your model, you can compile it with a specified loss function, optimizer, and metrics using the compile() method.

model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer='adam',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
              
After the model is compiled, you can train it on your data using the fit() method and then use it to make predictions on new data
using the predict() method.

model.fit(X_train, y_train,
          batch_size=batch_size,
          epochs=num_epochs,
          validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

predictions = model.predict(X_test)
