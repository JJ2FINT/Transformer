# Transformer-Model-NLP

 A transformer model is a type of neural network architecture used for natural             
  language processing tasks such as language translation, text summarization,              
  and question answering. It was introduced in the 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need"  
  by Google researchers. The transformer uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh           
  the importance of different parts of the input when generating the output,               
  allowing it to effectively handle input sequences of varying lengths                     
  and to parallelize computations across the sequence. This has made transformer           
  models the go-to choice for many NLP tasks, and they have been shown to achieve          
  state-of-the-art results on a wide range of benchmarks.
