Transformer Model NLP
This repository contains an implementation of the Transformer model for Natural Language Processing using Keras.
The model is based on the Neural Machine Translation with Transformer example from the Keras documentation.

# Requirements
  Keras
  TensorFlow
  Numpy
  Matplotlib
  
# Usage
To train the model, run the transformer_model_nlp.py file. The example uses the same data and preprocessing as the Keras
example, but the model and training parameters can be easily modified to fit your specific use case.

# Results
The model was trained on the same data and for the same number of epochs as the Keras example, and achieved similar 
results in terms of accuracy and loss. The results can be visualized and they are provided in the positinal_encoding_matrix.py file.

# Acknowledgements
This implementation was created as part of a study of the Transformer model and its applications in NLP. 
Special thanks to the Keras team for providing the original example and to **Yazidi Yassine** for sharing this implementation on GitHub.
